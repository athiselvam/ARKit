# Requirements

- Xcode 9
- iOS 11
- An iOS device with an A9 or better processor (iPhone 6s or superior, iPad Pro, iPad 2017)

# Installation
1. Clone this repository and `cd` into it.
2. Open the project in Xcode 9.
4. You have to run the project in a real device with iOS 11. AR wonâ€™t work in the simulator, so configure a team to sign your app (a paid developer account is not required for testing in one device).
